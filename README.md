Manage and Run V8 Isolates as a service via a Restful API

As of now, mostly fun and hobby project.

### Idea

Create, run and manage V8 Isolates with a Restful API.
Intended to be used in secured environment, though there is authorization via 1 time passwords

### Folder structure
Monorepo containing the old express+sequilize based implementation and the new WIP nest + typeorm implementation.
View the README inside the folders for more documentation.
